- 👋 Hi, I’m @Reaper-firemoth. My real name is actually Timilehin Olutaiwo. 
- 👀 I’m interested in all things nerdy, at least I like to think so. Animes, Movies, Series, Books (mostly novels), Scrabble (English is actually hard) and others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science and hopefully Data Engineering/Software Engineering
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet. I'm still like a baby chick just observing the mother hen (everyone else) as they do their thing and pick things up as they go
- 📫 How to reach me (email:timitaiwo97@gmail.com)
